# Mindex Coding Challenge
## What's Provided
A simple [.NetCore 2.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/sdk-2.1.300) web application has been created and bootstrapped 
with data. The application contains information about all employees at a company. On application start-up, an in-memory 
database is bootstrapped with a serialized snapshot of the database. While the application runs, the data may be
accessed and mutated in the database without impacting the snapshot.

### How to Run
You can run this by executing `dotnet run` on the command line or in [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).


### How to Use
The following endpoints are available to use:
```
* CREATE
    * HTTP Method: POST 
    * URL: localhost:8080/api/employee
    * PAYLOAD: Employee
    * RESPONSE: Employee
* READ
    * HTTP Method: GET 
    * URL: localhost:8080/api/employee/{id}
    * RESPONSE: Employee
* UPDATE
    * HTTP Method: PUT 
    * URL: localhost:8080/api/employee/{id}
    * PAYLOAD: Employee
    * RESPONSE: Employee
```
The Employee has a JSON schema of:
```json
{
  "type":"Employee",
  "properties": {
    "employeeId": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "firstName": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "lastName": {
          "type": "string"
    },
    "position": {
          "type": "string"
    },
    "department": {
          "type": "string"
    },
    "directReports": {
      "type": "array",
      "items" : "string"
    }
  }
}
```
For all endpoints that require an "id" in the URL, this is the "employeeId" field.

## What to Implement
Clone or download the repository, do not fork it.

### Task 1
Create a new type, ReportingStructure, that has two properties: employee and numberOfReports.

For the field "numberOfReports", this should equal the total number of reports under a given employee. The number of 
reports is determined to be the number of directReports for an employee and all of their direct reports. For example, 
given the following employee structure:
```
                    John Lennon
                /               \
         Paul McCartney         Ringo Starr
                               /        \
                          Pete Best     George Harrison
```
The numberOfReports for employee John Lennon (employeeId: 16a596ae-edd3-4847-99fe-c4518e82c86f) would be equal to 4. 

This new type should have a new REST endpoint created for it. This new endpoint should accept an employeeId and return 
the fully filled out ReportingStructure for the specified employeeId. The values should be computed on the fly and will 
not be persisted.

### Task 2
Create a new type, Compensation. A Compensation has the following fields: employee, salary, and effectiveDate. Create 
two new Compensation REST endpoints. One to create and one to read by employeeId. These should persist and query the 
Compensation from the persistence layer.

## Delivery
Please upload your results to a publicly accessible Git repo. Free ones are provided by Github and Bitbucket.

## Implementation
### Task 1
For task 1, I created a new Entity called ReportingStructure with an `int` property for Number of reports and an `Employee` property for the actual employee.
Moreover, I implemented the service layer of the Repository-Service pattern. Since the reporting structure should not persist I didn't implement the Repository layer.

### Task 2
For task 2, I created a new Entity called compensation with the properties: `Guid` Id for the unique identifier of the compensation, `Employee` for the employe the compensation is for, `double` salary, and `DateTime` EffectiveDate.
Since the compensation data should persist, I added a DbSet to the context and implemented the Repository and Service layer.

### Testing
For testing purposes, I added a mock compensation in the Seed method.
Implemented tests for the:
- GET method of the Compensation Controller
- POST method of the Compensation Controller
- GET method of the Reporting Structure Controller
